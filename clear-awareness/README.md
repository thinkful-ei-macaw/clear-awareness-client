# Clear-mind Client

## Introduction

- Welcome to Clear-Mind.

- Explore your feelings and thoughts with daily journals and personal data tracking.

- This digital journaling application allows users to keep track of daily tasks, record inner thoughts, encourage mindful acts, and track sleep and emotional patterns.

- Upon submitting a journal entry, the user's dashboard will update to display emotion and sleep data, allowing the user to see a visual representation of their progress over time.

- The user can use the calendar on the mindfulness center page to navigate to a specific day's journal and update entries to their liking.
